# 1. You slept for 6.2, 7, 8, 5, 6.5, 7.1, and 8.5 hours this week. Calculate the average number of hours slept.
# 4. Wikipedia defines leap years as:
# Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that
# are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they
# are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are
# not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year
# Write Python code to determine if 1800, 1900, 1903, 2000, and 2002 are leap years.
