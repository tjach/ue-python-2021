# 1. Create a variable with your name stored as a string. Use indexing operations to pull
# out the first character. Pull out the last character. Will your code to pull out the last
# character work on a name of arbitrary length?


# 2. Create a variable, filename. Assuming that it has a three letter extension, and using
# slice operations, find the extension. For README.txt, the extension should be txt.
# Write code using slice operations that will give the name without the extension. Does
# your code work on filenames of arbitrary length?


# 3. Create a function, is_palindrome, to determine if a supplied word is the same if the letters are reversed.
