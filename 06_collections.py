# Create a list. Append the names of your colleagues and friends to it. Has the id of the
# list changed? Sort the list. What is the first item in the list? What is the second item in
# the list?

# 2. Create a tuple with your first name, last name, and age. Create a list, people, and
# append your tuple to it. Make more tuples with the corresponding information from
# your friends and append them to the list. Sort the list.

# 4. Go to Project Gutenberg11 and find a page of text from Shakespeare. Paste it into a
# triple-quoted string. Create another string with a paragraph of text from Ralph Waldo
# Emerson. Use the stringâ€™s .split method to get a list of words from each. Using set
# operations find the common words and words unique to both authors.


# 5. Tuples and lists are similar but have different behavior. Use set operations to find the
# attributes of a list object that are not in a tuple object.
